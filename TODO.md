critical improvement needed based on current patroling pawns behavior
- cluster search: neigbor nodes for gate should be achable gates and neighbor gate
- movement component should apply different strategies for next tile if one failed and update them every second
- pawn should update patrol logic every second
- if pawn has next tile, it should immedatly free current tile and occupy next tile


HPA Pathfinding improvements
- Cache results of path searches
- Add async path query with caching on finish
- Add obstacle handling in HPA moving strategy
- Add neighbor gates caching in Gate class

if units are on the same tile, lets push them around on free tiles
